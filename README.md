It has pipelines that I used to analyze the data I collected during my master degree - virtual reality and electrophysiological signals. \
Here we will have pipelines, in python, to process biological signals from EEG (MNE-python) and ECG (Neurokit2) and \
questionnaires (chronotype - HO and MCTQ, Presence - iGroup, Cybersickess - SSQ, and Anxiety, depression and stress - DASS-21). \
